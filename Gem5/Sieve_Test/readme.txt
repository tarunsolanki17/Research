The Sieve of Eratosthenes program, for the calculation of number of prime numbers from 1 to n has been executed in Gem5 and has been tested on two CPU Models, namely Timing Simple CPU and Minor CPU.

The execution in Gem5 has been carried out using the config file named sieve-config.py which consists of a two level cache implementation.

The Sieve.cpp contains the program and a.out is its binary produced.

The tests performed can be viewed in the PDF named Sieve_Tests.pdf
